**Modified Datasets Use Tips:**

1. The Modified Datasets are based on the following two authors, on whose collected image data I have manually tagged:

- [gengyanlei/fire-smoke-detect-yolov4: fire-smoke-detect-yolov4-yolov5 and fire-smoke-detection-dataset 火灾检测，烟雾检测 (github.com)](https://github.com/gengyanlei/fire-smoke-detect-yolov4)
- [spacewalk01/yolov5-fire-detection: Training YOLOv5 to detect fire in a video (github.com)](https://github.com/spacewalk01/yolov5-fire-detection)
2. The validation sets are automatically classified according to the ratio of 0.2, if necessary, you can set your own ratio to re-subscribe.
